# Computer Architecture Gitpod Repo

This repo contains a small bare-bones Gitpod configuration file which sets up
`nasm` and `gcc` for use in the Compute Architecture course of the Freie Universit√§t
Berlin.  Simply follow the following link
gitpod.io/#https://github.com/LeonardKoenig/fu-ca-gitpod
to open the editor in your browser.  It's set up for use with C (using GCC) and x86
Assembly (using NASM).

If you want to use this repo as a basis for your own code, **please** fork it and open
Gitpod again **with the new URL** pointing to your repo.  Also, if you want to commit
files to Git other than files named `Makefile` or with the file extensions `*.nasm`,
`*.c` and `*.asm`, don't forget to add these as exceptions to the
[Git ignore file](.gitignore).
